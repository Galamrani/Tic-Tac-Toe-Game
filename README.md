## About the game
The game is played on a 3 Ã— 3 grid.  
  The AI player will play the first turn.  
    The players take turns placing a mark in one of the available cells of the grid, until the grid is full and there is no winner 
or one of the players position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## MiniMax Algorithm
The MiniMax Algorithm used in decision making, game theory and artificial intelligence (AI). 
It is used to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that the opponent is also playing optimally.
In the context of the game we will see the AI Player blocking the User Player if necessary or making the best possible move for a winning opportunity.

I added to the algorithm some extra features :  
  
1. Shortest route - so even if the user player is not playing optimally the AI player will still play in an optimally  way and look for the fastest way to win.

2. Alpha-Beta pruning - an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm, it reduces the computation time by a huge factor, this allows us to search much faster and                         even go into deeper levels in the game tree.
  it cuts off branches in the game tree which need not be searched because there already exists a better move available. It is called Alpha-Beta pruning because it       passes 2 extra parameters in the minimax function, namely alpha and beta.
  
  Alpha is the best value that the maximizer currently can guarantee at that level or above. 
  Beta is the best value that the minimizer currently can guarantee at that level or above.
